    <hr>

    <p style="font-size: larger;">
<em>Romerolagus diazi</em> was first described by the head of the Mexican
 Geographical and Exploring Commission, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Ferrari-P%C3%A9rez">Fernando Ferrari-Pérez</a>,
  in 1893 as a member of the hares (genus <em>Lepus</em>), using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_name">scientific
   name</a> <em>Lepus diazi</em> and common name <em>conejo del Volcán</em> (volcano rabbit).
 The species name diazi honors the Mexican <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartographer">cartographer</a> Agustín 
   Díaz, who published the work where the species was first described.
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_specimen">type specimen</a> was collected on the northeastern slopes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixtacc%C3%ADhuatl">Ixtaccíhuatl</a>,
     a volcano near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Mart%C3%ADn_Texmelucan">San Martín Texmelucan</a>, in the Mexican state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebla">Puebla</a>.
      It was separately described as the Popocatepetl rabbit, <em>Romerolagus nelsoni</em>,
       in 1896 by American zoologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Hart_Merriam">Clinton Hart Merriam</a> in an account that made
        no reference to the earlier work of Ferrari-Pérez. Merriam noted a type specimen
         that was collected on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popocat%C3%A9petl">Popocatépetl</a> at an altitude of 3,350 metres (10,990 feet)
          by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_William_Nelson">Edward William Nelson</a>, an American naturalist for whom Merriam named the species.
           Merriam noted several characteristics that differed significantly from any member of the hares,
            such as its anatomy and means of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotion_in_mammals">locomotion</a> (running on all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupedalism">four legs</a> rather than hopping),
             and gave it the genus name Romerolagus in honor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat%C3%ADas_Romero">Matías Romero</a>, Mexican ambassador in the United States
              and a supporter of the United States Biological Survey in Mexico.
               American zoologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Smith_Miller_Jr.">Gerrit Smith Miller Jr.</a> noted the discrepancy
                between the two descriptions and, after consulting with Nelson
                 and Ferrari-Pérez in 1911, clarified the nomenclature of the
                  species by using the name Romerolagus diazi, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatio_nova">new combination</a>,
                   and making Romerolagus nelsoni and Lepus diazi <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym_(taxonomy)"></a>synonyms of the
                    new name. From this point up until the 1950s, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature#Authority">authority</a>
                     of the species was attributed to Díaz alone; biologist Paulino
                      Rojas Mendoza argued in 1952 that the correct name under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature">International Code
                       of Zoological Nomenclature</a> rules would be one that credits Ferrari-Pérez as well.
                        Since then, the scientific name and authority of the volcano rabbit has been
                        Romerolagus diazi (Ferrari-Pérez in A. Díaz, 1893).
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        The volcano rabbit is named for its preferred habitat
        , that being the slopes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano">volcanoes</a>. One <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> name
        , <em>zacatochtle</em>, refers to the rabbit's relationship with
         subalpine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tussock_grass">tussock grass</a> in the genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festuca"><em>Festuca</em></a> (referred
          to as zacate in Spanish, zacatl in Nahuatl). The name
           comes from the combination of <em>zacatl</em> and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tochtli"><em>tochtle</em></a> ('rabbit')
           , and has been modified to the currently-used epithet <em>zacatuche</em>
            ('grass rabbit'). Another common name, <em>teporingo</em>, likely
             derives from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Nahuatl">Classical Nahuatl</a>, combining <em>tepētl</em> ('mountain'), <em>olīn</em>
              ('movement') and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix">suffix</a> <strong>-co</strong> referring to location. Several
               accounts of the species find no obvious etymology for this name,
                and tentatively ascribe it to a corruption of another name in Nahuatl.

    <h3>Phylogeny</h3>

    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        No subspecies of the volcano rabbit are recognized
        , and it is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotypic_genus">only species</a> within its genus.
         No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil">fossils</a> of the volcano rabbit are known,
          but analysis of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)">morphology</a> and genetic records
           indicate that it is the most morphologically primitive
            living <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leporidae">leporid</a>.
             The species has high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity">genetic diversity</a>
              and is separated into five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup">haplogroups</a>

                across its distribution; these groups appear to have
                 some level of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_flow">gene flow</a> between them due to the short
                  distance between populations. It was in 1929 placed

    <h3>Characteristics</h3>

    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        The volcano rabbit is one of the smallest rabbits in the world,
         having an adult weight that ranges from 386 to 602 g
          (0.851 to 1.327 lb) and a total length of 23.4 to 31.1
           centimeters (9.2 to 12.2 in). Its ears are small and
            rounded, measuring less than 4 centimeters (1.6 in)
             in length, and the hind feet are short, measuring
              4.2 to 5.5 centimeters (1.7 to 2.2 in). It has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestigial">vestigial</a>
               tail only visible in young rabbits and becomes hidden under the
                skin in adulthood. Three pairs of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammary_gland">mammary glands</a> are present
                 in female rabbits. The volcano rabbit has dense, short fur.
                  Its fur is yellowish brown across all of its body, and is softer on
                   the rabbit's underside. Each hair is black at the base and tip
                    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimony_yellow">antimony yellow</a> in the middle. This fur color changes only near
                     the nose, eyes, and at the base of the ears, where it appears more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff_(colour)">buff</a>.
                      The dark coloration of the volcano rabbit's fur blends in with the volcanic
                      soils in its habitat. This adaptation may help it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage#Zoology">evade predators</a>. Its coat does
                       not change color from one season to the next. However, it does undergo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulting">molting</a> in four
                        stages over the course of the year. First, hair is lost, then melanin disappears, then
                         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin">melanin</a> is deposited at the site of hair loss, after which hair regrows. The volcano
                          rabbit strongly resembles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika">pikas</a>, closely related mountain-dwelling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagomorph">lagomorphs</a>, though
                           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Ward_Lyon_Jr.">Marcus Ward Lyon Jr.</a>, a naturalist credited with the complete classification of the rabbit
                            and hare <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus">genera</a>, notes it as being closest in appearance to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amami_rabbit">Amami rabbit</a>.
